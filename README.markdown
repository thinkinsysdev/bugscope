# Bugscope

Bugscope is a simple bug repository app that lets you share bugs, add comments and vote on bugs.

Bugscope is entirely based on Microscope (including blatant copying of styles)

It was built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) as a companion app to [The Meteor Book](http://themeteorbook.com), and is the "little brother" of [Telescope](http://telesc.pe), the (much more complex) open-source social news app that was the inspiration for the book. 

Microscope itself is free and open-source, and is a good example of common Meteor app patterns such as:

- Routing
- User Accounts
- Notifications
- Errors
- Publications/Subscriptions
- Permissions

Thanks to Tom Coleman and Sacha Greif for creating a wonderful base to work on!

More updates to styling coming soon...
